## Preamble
As a part of the T-SQL course by Edx, i am installing the Adventure work db to my local machine
Rationale is so that i am able to better understand SQL
The course is purely dependent on the data camp tests, i found them to be too easy
Hope this playing around would allow me to really grasp the core concepts


## SQL_Installation_RestoreDB
-How i went about installalling SQL server 2014 and SQL management studio - Not sure if i really had to install SQL server?

- Browse to http://msftdbprodsamples.codeplex.com/releases/view/55330, and click the link to
download AdventureWorksLT2012_Data (be careful to choose this download and not any of the
others!) 

- Save the AdventureWorksLT2012_Data.mdf - could not locate the .mdf extention ended up just using the .bak edition

- Saved on location F:\New folder\Common7\IDE\SqlWorkbenchProjectItems\Sql\Backup, which is my SSMS data area

- retored db and picked above file

- happy days :)
